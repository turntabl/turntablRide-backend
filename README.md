## Authentication

All APIs routes are protected. The API expects a Bearer Token that can be obtained by performing
an oauth2 log in on the client using legitimate credentials and requesting an access token from
the oauth2 provider, Google in this case.
The Oauth2 log in request will require a client id ad client secret

## Instructions for OAuth2 setup on Spring for Development

Retrieve client-id and client-secret from Google API Console for turntablRides project.

The active profile has been indicated as dev

Create `application-dev.yml`

CLIENT_ID: [insert client-id here]

Note that the same client-id and secret is what front end clients would use to obtain an access token that the Spring Backend can use for authentication
